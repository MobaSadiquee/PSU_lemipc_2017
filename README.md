# lemIPC
Semaphores and Segments of Shared Memory

EPITECH second year project.

Little IA movement using shared memory on unix (IPC)
The goal is to fight players (divided between several teams) on a two-dimensional game board.
• The last team standing wins.
• To kill a player, a minimum of two players from the same team (and different from the first) must be
in contact with the other player. This means on a square next to the one where the player you want
to kill is standing (including diagonally).
• The players will be able to move both vertically and horizontally.
